# Figma Clone Project

This repository houses the files for one of my React projects: a Figma clone - one of the leading web design tools available today.

## Why This Project?

Figma is a complex tool that allows users to build page designs using a series of preset components that can be customised to their hearts content.

It's depth of features makes it a great project to build and add to my portfolio.

## What Tools Did You Use?

For something like this, `NextJS` would be an ideal framework to use, but I wanted to challenge myself and build it with bare bones `React`. Here's the tech stack:

- `React` - the heart and soul of the project
- `TypeScript` - for prop type safety
- `DaisyUi` - minimalist component library
- `Tailwind CSS` - utility CSS classes
- `ReactRouter` - for client side routing
- `ReactQuery` - for server state management
